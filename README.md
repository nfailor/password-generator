# Password Generator

## NAME
The name of this webpage is Password Generator.

## DESCRIPTION
This webpage is designed to prompt users for the requirements they would like their new password to be, and the form will generate a random password fit to the user's chosen requirements. 

## PROGRAMS USED
I used HTML and CSS to create the contents of this webpage and javascript to create the prompt. Git/Github were used as version control and deployed to Github Pages.

## INSTALLATION
This is a website only and does not need installation. it is currently hosted in github and you can access it at Github; https://nfailor.github.io/password-generator/

If the user would like to include lowercase characters, they would select 'Ok.' If they would like to exclude lowercase characters, just select 'Cancel.' Upon making their choice, the user will find three similar prompts, addresses uppercase characters, numbers, and special characters. After all selections have been made, the prompt window will disappear, and the user's new password will be displayed inside the dash-lined box, as seen below:
